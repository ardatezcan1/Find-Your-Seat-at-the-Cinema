# Find-Your-Seat-at-the-Cinema

Tickets can be purchased for one or more than one seat side by side from a movie theater represented by a matrix of n*m size.

Each customer who wants to buy a ticket is asked how many tickets he wants to buy and the row and column number of the first of the seats to be bought. If the seats requested by the customer are vacant, these seats will be reserved and the customer will be given a reservation number that automatically increases starting from one. If there are no empty seats next to each other in the desired number and place, the system will start searching from the upper right corner of the hall and reserve the first available seats.
